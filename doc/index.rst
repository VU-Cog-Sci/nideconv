.. image:: _static/deconv.png

Nideconv is an easy-to use Python library that can perform automated 
deconvolution of (primarily) slowly fluctuating (proxies of) neural signals like 
pupil size and BOLD fMRI. It was developed at the Vrije Universiteit 
and the Spinoza Centre for Neuroimaging by Gilles de Hollander and Tomas Knapen.
