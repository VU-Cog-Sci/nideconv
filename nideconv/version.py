Nideconv
========
Nideconv is a package that allows you to perform
impulse response shape fitting on time series data,
in order to estimate event-related signals.


Example use cases are fMRI and pupil size analysis.
The package performs the linear least squares analysis
using numpy.linalg as a backend, but can switch
between different backends, such as statsmodels (which is not yet implemented).
For very collinear design matrices ridge regression is
implemented through the sklearn RidgeCV function.


It is possible to add covariates to the events to estimate
not just the impulse response function, but also correlation
timecourses with secondary variables. Furthermore, one can add
the duration each event should have in the designmatrix,
for designs in which the durations of the events vary.


In neuroscience, the inspection of the event-related signals
such as those estimated by nideconv is essential
for a thorough understanding of one's data. Researchers may
overlook essential patterns in their data when blindly
running GLM analyses without looking at the impulse response shapes.

To get started using these components in your own software, please go to the
repository README_.
